## Personality Elasticity System (Completed: 2025-06-04)

### Overview
Implemented a dynamic personality trait system that allows AI players to change their behavior based on game events while maintaining their core identity.

### What Was Built

#### Core Components
1. **ElasticityManager** (`poker/elasticity_manager.py`)
   - Manages elastic personalities for all AI players
   - Tracks trait changes and applies recovery
   - Full serialization support for persistence

2. **PressureEventDetector** (`poker/pressure_detector.py`)
   - Detects game events (wins, losses, bluffs, eliminations)
   - Calculates and applies pressure to personality traits
   - Integrates seamlessly with game flow

3. **ElasticTrait & ElasticPersonality** Classes
   - Individual traits with defined elasticity bounds
   - Pressure accumulation and threshold-based changes
   - Mood vocabulary system for dynamic descriptions

#### Integration Points
- **AIPokerPlayer**: Added `elastic_personality` attribute and methods
- **AIPlayerController**: Uses current elastic trait values for decisions
- **Game Flow**: Pressure events detected during showdowns and eliminations
- **Persistence**: Full save/load support for elastic personality state

### Key Features Delivered
- ✅ Traits change within elasticity bounds based on game events
- ✅ Pressure system with configurable thresholds
- ✅ Automatic trait recovery toward baseline values
- ✅ Mood vocabulary that reflects current emotional state
- ✅ Full persistence support
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (10 unit tests)
- ✅ Demo scripts showing the system in action

### Technical Implementation

#### Pressure Events
```python
pressure_events = {
    "big_win": {"aggression": +0.2, "chattiness": +0.3, "bluff_tendency": +0.1},
    "big_loss": {"aggression": -0.3, "chattiness": -0.2, "emoji_usage": -0.1},
    "successful_bluff": {"bluff_tendency": +0.3, "aggression": +0.2},
    "bluff_called": {"bluff_tendency": -0.4, "aggression": -0.1},
    "eliminated_opponent": {"aggression": +0.3, "chattiness": +0.2},
    "bad_beat": {"aggression": -0.2, "bluff_tendency": -0.3}
}
```

#### Example Flow
1. Gordon Ramsay (aggression: 0.95) loses big pot
2. "big_loss" event applies -0.3 pressure to aggression
3. Trait changes to 0.80 (within elasticity bounds)
4. Mood updates from "intense" to "frustrated"
5. AI decisions reflect lower aggression
6. Over time, trait recovers back toward 0.95

- Usage examples in `CLAUDE.md`
- Test coverage with 10 passing unit tests

### Impact
This feature significantly enhances the realism and engagement of AI opponents by:
- Making personalities feel more alive and reactive
- Creating emergent narratives through trait changes
- Adding strategic depth (tilted players play differently)
- Improving immersion through dynamic mood descriptions

### Future Extensions
While the core system is complete, potential enhancements include:
- Elastic relationships between players
- Permanent trait changes from extreme events
- UI indicators for pressure and mood
- More nuanced pressure event detection
- Player-specific elasticity configurations

   - RESTful API design

2. **API Endpoints**
   - `/api/new-game` - Create new games
   - `/api/game-state/<id>` - Get game state
   - `/api/game/<id>/action` - Player actions
   - `/api/personalities` - Manage AI personalities
   - `/api/game/<id>/elasticity` - Get trait elasticity data

#### Docker Compose Setup
1. **Multi-Service Architecture**
   - React frontend container
   - Flask backend container
   - Redis for session management
   - Nginx for production (optional)

2. **Development Features**
