## Personality Elasticity System (Completed: 2025-06-04)

### Overview
Implemented a dynamic personality trait system that allows AI players to change their behavior based on game events while maintaining their core identity.

### What Was Built

#### Core Components
1. **ElasticityManager** (`poker/elasticity_manager.py`)
   - Manages elastic personalities for all AI players
   - Tracks trait changes and applies recovery
   - Full serialization support for persistence

2. **PressureEventDetector** (`poker/pressure_detector.py`)
   - Detects game events (wins, losses, bluffs, eliminations)
   - Calculates and applies pressure to personality traits
   - Integrates seamlessly with game flow

3. **ElasticTrait & ElasticPersonality** Classes
   - Individual traits with defined elasticity bounds
   - Pressure accumulation and threshold-based changes
   - Mood vocabulary system for dynamic descriptions

#### Integration Points
- **AIPokerPlayer**: Added `elastic_personality` attribute and methods
- **AIPlayerController**: Uses current elastic trait values for decisions
- **Game Flow**: Pressure events detected during showdowns and eliminations
- **Persistence**: Full save/load support for elastic personality state

### Key Features Delivered
- ✅ Traits change within elasticity bounds based on game events
- ✅ Pressure system with configurable thresholds
- ✅ Automatic trait recovery toward baseline values
- ✅ Mood vocabulary that reflects current emotional state
- ✅ Full persistence support
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (10 unit tests)
- ✅ Demo scripts showing the system in action

### Technical Implementation

#### Pressure Events
```python
pressure_events = {
    "big_win": {"aggression": +0.2, "chattiness": +0.3, "bluff_tendency": +0.1},
    "big_loss": {"aggression": -0.3, "chattiness": -0.2, "emoji_usage": -0.1},
    "successful_bluff": {"bluff_tendency": +0.3, "aggression": +0.2},
    "bluff_called": {"bluff_tendency": -0.4, "aggression": -0.1},
    "eliminated_opponent": {"aggression": +0.3, "chattiness": +0.2},
    "bad_beat": {"aggression": -0.2, "bluff_tendency": -0.3}
}
```

#### Example Flow
1. Gordon Ramsay (aggression: 0.95) loses big pot
2. "big_loss" event applies -0.3 pressure to aggression
3. Trait changes to 0.80 (within elasticity bounds)
4. Mood updates from "intense" to "frustrated"
5. AI decisions reflect lower aggression
6. Over time, trait recovers back toward 0.95

#### Modified Files
- `poker/poker_player.py` - Added elastic personality to AIPokerPlayer
- `poker/controllers.py` - Updated to use elastic trait values
- `docs/AI_PLAYER_SYSTEM.md` - Added elasticity integration section
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added elasticity system documentation
- `README.md` - Added feature to key features list

### Documentation
- Comprehensive system documentation in `/docs/ELASTICITY_SYSTEM.md`
- Integration notes in `/docs/AI_PLAYER_SYSTEM.md`
- Usage examples in `CLAUDE.md`
- Test coverage with 10 passing unit tests

### Impact
This feature significantly enhances the realism and engagement of AI opponents by:
- Making personalities feel more alive and reactive
- Creating emergent narratives through trait changes
- Adding strategic depth (tilted players play differently)
- Improving immersion through dynamic mood descriptions

### Future Extensions
While the core system is complete, potential enhancements include:
- Elastic relationships between players
- Permanent trait changes from extreme events
- UI indicators for pressure and mood
- More nuanced pressure event detection
- Player-specific elasticity configurations

## Repository Pattern Implementation (Completed: 2025-06-05)

### Overview
Implemented the Repository Pattern to provide clean separation between business logic and data storage, making the codebase more maintainable and testable.

### What Was Built

#### Core Components
1. **Base Repository Interface** (`poker/repositories/base.py`)
   - Abstract base classes defining repository contracts
   - Ensures consistent API across different storage backends

2. **SQLite Repositories** (`poker/repositories/sqlite_repositories.py`)
   - Concrete implementations for production use
   - Handles all database operations
   - Proper transaction management

3. **Memory Repositories** (`poker/repositories/memory_repositories.py`)
   - In-memory implementations for testing
   - Fast, isolated test execution
   - No database dependencies

4. **Game Service Layer** (`poker/services/game_service.py`)
   - Business logic using repository interfaces
   - Storage-agnostic game operations
   - Clean separation of concerns

### Key Benefits
- ✅ Easy to swap storage backends
- ✅ Simplified testing with in-memory repositories
- ✅ Better code organization
- ✅ Reduced coupling between layers
- ✅ Follows SOLID principles

### Technical Implementation
```python
# Example usage
from poker.repositories.sqlite_repositories import SQLiteGameRepository
from poker.services.game_service import GameService

# Production setup
game_repo = SQLiteGameRepository("poker_games.db")
service = GameService(game_repo)

# Save game
service.save_game(game_state)

# Load game
loaded_state = service.load_game(game_id)
```

### Files Added

## Customizable Player Name (Completed: 2025-06-05)

### Overview
Removed the hardcoded "Jeff" player name, allowing users to enter their own name when starting a game.

### What Was Changed

1. **Game Initialization** (`poker/poker_game.py`)
   - `initialize_game_state()` now accepts optional `human_player_name` parameter
   - Defaults to "Player 1" if no name provided
   - Maintains backward compatibility

2. **Web Interface** (`flask_app/ui_web.py`)
   - Added player name prompt on game start
   - Stores player name in session
   - Passes name to game initialization

3. **React UI** (`react/react/src/components/PlayerNameEntry.tsx`)
   - Created dedicated component for name entry
   - Clean, user-friendly interface
   - Validates input before proceeding

### Technical Implementation
```python
# Before
def initialize_game_state(ai_player_configs):
    human_player = Player(name="Jeff", stack=10000, is_human=True)
    
# After
def initialize_game_state(ai_player_configs, human_player_name="Player 1"):
    human_player = Player(name=human_player_name, stack=10000, is_human=True)
```

### Impact

- Removes a long-standing limitation mentioned in multiple documentation files
- Improves user engagement and immersion
