# T2-19: Add TTL-based eviction for in-memory game state

## Problem

The module-level `games` dict in `flask_app/services/game_state_service.py` stores all active games but has no eviction mechanism. Games are removed only when the frontend calls `/api/end_game`. Abandoned games (browser closed, crash, disconnect) remain in memory indefinitely. Each game is ~200-500 KB, growing to 1-5 MB for long tournaments.

## What Changed

In `flask_app/services/game_state_service.py`:

1. Added `game_last_access: Dict[str, datetime]` to track last access time per game
2. Added `GAME_TTL_HOURS = 2` constant
3. Added `_cleanup_stale_games()` function that evicts games not accessed within the TTL
4. Updated `get_game()` to trigger cleanup and update access time on hit
5. Updated `set_game()` to trigger cleanup and update access time
6. Updated `delete_game()` to also clean up `game_locks` and `game_last_access`

## What the Test Verifies

- Creating a game and accessing it within TTL keeps it alive
- A game not accessed for longer than GAME_TTL_HOURS is evicted on next cleanup
- Accessing a different game triggers cleanup of stale games
- `delete_game()` cleans up all associated tracking dicts
- Evicted games return None from `get_game()` (lazy reload from SQLite happens at the route level in `game_routes.py:266-368`)
