# T2-17: Add `atexit` cleanup for shared HTTP client

## Problem

`core/llm/providers/http_client.py` creates a module-level `httpx.Client()` singleton with up to 20 keepalive connections. There is no shutdown hook, so the client is never explicitly closed. While the OS reclaims sockets on process exit, proper cleanup prevents resource warnings and is necessary for clean shutdown.

## What Changed

Added an `atexit` handler that calls `shared_http_client.close()` on process exit. The handler catches all exceptions to avoid crashes on double-close or already-closed clients.

## Test

`tests/test_http_client_cleanup.py` verifies:
1. The `atexit` module's `register` function is called during module import
2. The registered callback calls `shared_http_client.close()`
3. The cleanup function handles exceptions gracefully (no crash on double-close)
