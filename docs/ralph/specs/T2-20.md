# T2-20: Cap in-memory message list at 200 entries with trim on append

## Problem

`send_message()` in `flask_app/handlers/message_handler.py` appends to `game_data['messages']` without any limit. A typical tournament generates 1,000-4,000 messages. The DB already caps at 100 messages on load, but the in-memory list grows unbounded during active play. AI players only use the last 8 messages.

## What Changed

In `flask_app/handlers/message_handler.py`:

1. Added `MAX_MESSAGES_IN_MEMORY = 200` constant
2. After appending a new message, check if the list exceeds the limit and trim to keep only the last 200 entries

## What the Test Verifies

- Adding messages up to the limit keeps all messages
- Adding messages beyond the limit trims to the last 200
- The most recent messages are retained (oldest are dropped)
- The trim happens automatically on each `send_message` call
