# T3-04: Fix skipped test in test_prompt_management.py

## Problem

Line 192 in `tests/test_prompt_management.py` had a skipped test:
```python
@unittest.skip("TODO: Update test to match current personality modifier text")
def test_personality_modifiers(self, mock_load_config):
```

The test was skipped because the `get_personality_modifier()` method in `poker/poker_player.py` was rewritten to use a unified strategy matrix based on poker archetypes (LAG, TAG, Tricky, Tight-Passive, etc.) instead of independent modifiers.

The old test expected:
- Donald Trump's modifier to contain "bluff" and "aggressive"
- Bob Ross's modifier to contain "cautiously" and "avoid"

But the new archetype system returns different text:
- Donald Trump (aggression=0.8, bluff=0.75) → LAG archetype → "Loose-Aggressive (LAG)"
- Bob Ross (aggression=0.1, bluff=0.3) → Tight-Passive → "Tight and patient"

## What Changed

Updated the test in `tests/test_prompt_management.py:192-210` to:
1. Removed the `@unittest.skip` decorator
2. Updated the test docstring to explain the archetype matrix
3. Changed assertions for Donald Trump to check for "loose-aggressive" and "bluff"
4. Changed assertions for Bob Ross to check for "tight and patient" and "fold"

## Test Verification

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_prompt_management.py::TestAIPokerPlayerPrompts::test_personality_modifiers -v
# Result: PASSED
```

The test now correctly validates that:
- High aggression + high bluff → LAG archetype
- Low aggression + low bluff → Tight-Passive archetype
