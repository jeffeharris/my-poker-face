# T1-07: Fix `player_idx=0` falsy bug

## Problem

In `poker/poker_game.py:394`, the `place_bet` function uses:

```python
player_idx = player_idx or game_state.current_player_idx
```

Python's `or` operator treats `0` as falsy. When `player_idx=0` is passed (meaning the first player), this expression evaluates to `game_state.current_player_idx` instead of using index `0`. This means bets intended for player 0 are incorrectly applied to the current player.

## Fix

Changed line 394 from:
```python
player_idx = player_idx or game_state.current_player_idx
```
to:
```python
if player_idx is None:
    player_idx = game_state.current_player_idx
```

This correctly distinguishes between "no index provided" (`None`) and "index 0 provided" (`0`).

## Test

`tests/test_poker_game.py::test_place_bet_with_player_idx_zero` — Creates a game state where `current_player_idx` is not 0, then calls `place_bet` with `player_idx=0`. Verifies that the bet is applied to player 0 (not the current player).
