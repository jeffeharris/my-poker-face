# T1-01: Delete `poker_action.py` (dead code)

## Problem
The file `poker/poker_action.py` contains two items:
- `PlayerAction` enum — used only as a non-enforced type annotation in `poker_player.py:20` (`options: List[PlayerAction]`). At runtime, `options` stores plain strings like `"fold"`, `"check"`, `"call"`.
- `PokerAction` class — completely unused. The `from_dict` method has a copy-paste bug (passes `player_action` as both player name and action), confirming it was never called.

Both are imported in `poker/__init__.py` and re-exported, but nothing outside the package uses them.

## Changes
1. Deleted `poker/poker_action.py`
2. Removed `from .poker_action import PokerAction, PlayerAction` from `poker/__init__.py`
3. Removed `'PokerAction'` and `'PlayerAction'` from `__all__` in `poker/__init__.py`
4. Updated `poker/poker_player.py`: removed `PlayerAction` import, changed type annotation from `List[PlayerAction]` to `List[str]`

## Test
- Verified zero external imports of `PokerAction` or `PlayerAction`
- Existing tests pass after deletion
