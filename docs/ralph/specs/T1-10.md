# T1-10: Fix name collision in `reset_player_action_flags`

## Problem

`reset_player_action_flags` in `poker/poker_game.py:429-438` compares players by `.name` and uses `.index(player)` to find the index. Two bugs:

1. **Name comparison**: `player.name != game_state.current_player.name` — if two players share a name, the wrong player(s) could be excluded from the reset.
2. **Index lookup**: `game_state.players.index(player)` returns the first match by equality, which may not be the current iteration's player if names collide.

Additionally, `initialize_game_state` does not validate that player names are unique, allowing the collision scenario.

## Fix

1. Refactored `reset_player_action_flags` to use `enumerate()` for index-safe iteration and compare by index (`idx != game_state.current_player_idx`) instead of by name.
2. Added duplicate name validation in `initialize_game_state` — raises `ValueError` if any player names (including the human player name) are duplicated.

## Tests

- `test_reset_flags_uses_index_not_name`: Verifies correct flag reset using index comparison by creating a game state with a known current player index and calling `reset_player_action_flags(exclude_current_player=True)`.
- `test_reset_flags_resets_all_when_not_excluding`: Verifies all players get reset when `exclude_current_player=False`.
- `test_initialize_game_state_rejects_duplicate_ai_names`: Verifies `ValueError` on duplicate AI player names.
- `test_initialize_game_state_rejects_ai_name_matching_human`: Verifies `ValueError` when an AI name matches the human player name.
