# T1-17: Add shared input validation for player actions

## Problem

Both the HTTP handler (`api_player_action` at `game_routes.py:982`) and the socket handler (`handle_player_action` at `game_routes.py:1216`) pass raw user input directly to `play_turn()`. The `play_turn` function uses `getattr()` with the action string to dynamically look up a function (`player_` + action), meaning an invalid action string causes an `AttributeError` crash. Additionally, the socket handler had no `is_human` check at all.

## What Changed

1. **Created `flask_app/validation.py`** with a shared `validate_player_action()` function that checks:
   - Current player is human
   - Action is in the set of valid actions (`fold`, `check`, `call`, `raise`, `all_in`)
   - Action is currently available in `game_state.current_player_options`
   - Raise amount is a valid number >= 0

2. **Modified HTTP handler** (`api_player_action`): Replaced the inline `is_human` check with `validate_player_action()` call before `play_turn()`. Returns 400 with error message on validation failure.

3. **Modified socket handler** (`handle_player_action`): Added `validate_player_action()` call before `play_turn()`. Previously had no validation at all (no is_human check, no action validation). Returns silently on invalid input.

## What the Tests Verify

- Invalid action string (e.g., `"hack"`) is rejected
- Negative raise amount is rejected
- Action during AI player's turn is rejected
- Action not in current options (e.g., `"raise"` when only fold/call available) is rejected
- Valid actions pass validation
