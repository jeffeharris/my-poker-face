# T2-15: Delete dead `setup_helper.py`

## Problem
`setup_helper.py` is a legacy setup script from the pre-Docker console-game era. It references `python working_game.py` (line 123), which no longer exists. The file is never imported or referenced by any active code.

## Verification
- Grep for `setup_helper` found zero results in active code (only in triage/ralph documentation)
- `working_game.py` does not exist in the repo
- Not referenced in Makefile, docker-compose, or any scripts
- Current setup uses Docker Compose (`make up` / `docker compose up`)

## Action
1. Confirmed zero imports via grep
2. Deleted `setup_helper.py`
3. Verified existing tests pass
