# T1-14: Add offline detection with toast notifications

## Problem
No `navigator.onLine` check or `online`/`offline` event listeners exist. When the network drops, users see a frozen UI with no feedback.

## What Changed
1. Created `react/react/src/hooks/useOnlineStatus.ts` — a custom React hook that:
   - Tracks `navigator.onLine` state
   - Listens for `online` and `offline` window events
   - Shows a persistent toast on offline (`duration: Infinity`)
   - Dismisses the offline toast and shows a "Back online" success toast on reconnection
   - Cleans up event listeners and toasts on unmount

2. Added `useOnlineStatus()` call in `App.tsx` at the root component level, ensuring offline detection is active app-wide.

## What the Test Verifies
- The hook file exports `useOnlineStatus`
- TypeScript type checking passes for the new hook and its usage in App.tsx
- Note: Full behavioral testing requires a DOM environment (jsdom/vitest) which is not yet set up for React tests in this project. A `.test.tsx` file is provided for future use.
