# T1-18: Add owner + is_human auth checks to WebSocket handlers

## Problem

The WebSocket event handlers `on_join` and `handle_player_action` in `flask_app/routes/game_routes.py` have no authentication checks. Anyone who knows a game ID can:
- Join a game room via `join_game` event
- Submit player actions via `player_action` event

The HTTP routes in the same file already use `auth_manager.get_current_user()` for authentication, but the socket handlers skip this entirely.

## What Changed

### `on_join` (line 1204)
Added ownership check: after looking up the game, verify the current user matches the game's `owner_id`. Non-owners are silently rejected (no room join, no game start).

### `handle_player_action` (line 1218)
Added ownership + is_human check: verify the current user is the game owner AND it's a human player's turn before processing the action. Non-owners and attempts to act during AI turns are silently rejected.

### Design decisions
- `auth_manager.get_current_user()` works in Flask-SocketIO handlers because Flask-SocketIO provides a request context
- If `auth_manager` is `None` (extensions not initialized) or user is `None` (unauthenticated), reject silently
- Owner check uses `user.get('id') != owner_id` — if either is None, they won't match, so unauthenticated users are rejected
- Silent rejection (return without emitting error) matches existing patterns in the handlers

## Test

`tests/test_triage_t1_18.py` verifies:
- Non-owner cannot join game room or trigger game start
- Owner can join game room and trigger game start
- Non-owner cannot submit player actions
- Owner can submit player actions (when it's human's turn)
- Unauthenticated user (no user) cannot join or act
