# T1-06: Remove pot x 2 raise cap

## Problem

Two locations cap max raise at `pot * 2`, which is not standard No-Limit Hold'em rules:

1. `poker/controllers.py:728`: `max_raise = min(player_stack, max_opponent_stack, game_state.pot['total'] * 2)` — used in AI decision context
2. `flask_app/handlers/game_handler.py:1205`: `max_raise = min(current_player.stack, state_machine.game_state.pot.get('total', 0) * 2)` — used in AI error fallback

In No-Limit Hold'em, a player can raise up to their entire stack. The pot x 2 cap artificially limits AI raise amounts.

## Changes

### `poker/controllers.py:728`
- **Before**: `max_raise = min(player_stack, max_opponent_stack, game_state.pot['total'] * 2)`
- **After**: `max_raise = min(player_stack, max_opponent_stack)`

### `flask_app/handlers/game_handler.py:1205`
- **Before**: `max_raise = min(current_player.stack, state_machine.game_state.pot.get('total', 0) * 2)`
- **After**: `max_raise = current_player.stack`

## Test

`tests/test_triage_t1_06.py` — verifies that:
1. AI controller max_raise is not capped by pot size when stacks are large
2. Fallback handler max_raise equals player stack without pot cap
