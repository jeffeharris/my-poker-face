# T3-20: Remove GET from Destructive Endpoint

## Problem

The `/api/end_game/<game_id>` endpoint accepted both GET and POST methods (line 1121 in `flask_app/routes/game_routes.py`). GET requests should never mutate server state — this violates HTTP semantics and could cause accidental game deletion from:
- Browser prefetch
- Search engine crawlers
- Link previews

## Change

Changed the route decorator from:
```python
@game_bp.route('/api/end_game/<game_id>', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
```

To:
```python
@game_bp.route('/api/end_game/<game_id>', methods=['POST'])
```

## Test

No new test file needed — this is a simple config change. The existing tests verify the endpoint still works with POST requests. A GET request would now return a 405 Method Not Allowed status.

## Files Changed

- `flask_app/routes/game_routes.py`: Line 1121 - removed 'GET' from methods list
