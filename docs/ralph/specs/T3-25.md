# T3-25: Add `.github/dependabot.yml`

## Problem
No Dependabot configuration existed. Dependency updates were manual, and security patches could be missed.

## Solution
Created `.github/dependabot.yml` with configuration for:

1. **pip** - Python dependencies in project root
2. **npm** - React frontend dependencies in `/react/react`
3. **github-actions** - GitHub Actions workflow versions

All ecosystems are configured to:
- Check for updates weekly on Mondays
- Limit open PRs to 5 (pip/npm) or 3 (github-actions)
- Apply appropriate labels for easy filtering

## Testing
No test required - this is a configuration file that GitHub will validate when pushed.
