# T1-04: `_check_two_pair` and `_check_one_pair` use `count >= 2` instead of `== 2`

## Problem

In `poker/hand_evaluator.py`:
- Line 162: `_check_two_pair` used `count >= 2` to find pairs, which also matches trips (count=3) and quads (count=4).
- Line 171: `_check_one_pair` used `count >= 2` with the same issue.

While the evaluation order (quads → full house → flush → straight → trips → two pair → one pair) means trips/quads are caught before reaching these methods during normal `evaluate_hand()` flow, using `== 2` is semantically correct and defensive against direct method calls or future refactoring.

## Verification

Confirmed the evaluation order in `evaluate_hand()` (lines 73-83):
1. Royal flush
2. Straight flush
3. Four of a kind
4. Full house
5. Flush
6. Straight
7. Three of a kind
8. **Two pair** (index 8)
9. **One pair** (index 9)

Trips (count=3) ARE checked before two-pair in normal flow. However, calling `_check_two_pair` directly on a hand with trips would incorrectly identify it as two-pair if another pair existed alongside.

## Changes

1. `poker/hand_evaluator.py:162`: Changed `count >= 2` to `count == 2` in `_check_two_pair`
2. `poker/hand_evaluator.py:171`: Changed `count >= 2` to `count == 2` in `_check_one_pair`

## Test

`tests/test_triage_t1_04.py`: Verifies that:
- A hand with three-of-a-kind is NOT detected as two-pair by `_check_two_pair`
- A hand with three-of-a-kind is NOT detected as one-pair by `_check_one_pair`
- Normal two-pair and one-pair detection still works correctly
- Full `evaluate_hand()` still correctly identifies trips, two-pair, and one-pair
