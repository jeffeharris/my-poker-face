# T3-24: Add `.editorconfig`

## Problem
No `.editorconfig` file exists in the project. Different editors use different tab/space/line-ending defaults, causing inconsistent formatting and noisy diffs.

## What was changed
Created `.editorconfig` in project root with standard settings matching the existing codebase conventions:
- Python files: 4-space indentation (verified from `poker/poker_game.py`)
- JavaScript/TypeScript files: 2-space indentation (verified from `react/react/src/App.tsx`)
- UTF-8 encoding, LF line endings
- Trailing whitespace trimmed (except Markdown where it's significant)
- Final newline inserted
- Makefiles use tabs (required by make)

## Test verification
No unit test needed - this is a static editor configuration file. Verification:
1. File exists at project root
2. Settings match existing code conventions (confirmed by inspection)
