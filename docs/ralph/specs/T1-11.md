# T1-11: Add React Error Boundaries

## Problem
No error boundary components exist. A single component render error crashes the entire app to a white screen with no recovery option.

## Changes
1. Created `react/react/src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` — a React class component that catches render errors in child components and displays a fallback UI with a "Reload" button and optional custom action (e.g., "Return to Menu").
2. Updated `react/react/src/App.tsx` to wrap `<Routes>` in a top-level `<ErrorBoundary>` and wrap the game route's `<GamePage>` in a per-route `<ErrorBoundary>` with a "Return to Menu" fallback action.
3. Exported `ErrorBoundary` from the shared components index.

## Test
- `react/react/src/components/ErrorBoundary.test.tsx` — verifies that a throwing child component renders the fallback UI instead of crashing.
- Note: requires vitest/jest setup with React Testing Library. The test file documents expected behavior.
