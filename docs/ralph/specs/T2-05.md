# T2-05: Cache GamePersistence in config getters

## Problem

Six config getter functions create a new `GamePersistence()` instance on every call:
- `flask_app/config.py`: `get_default_provider()`, `get_default_model()`, `get_assistant_provider()`, `get_assistant_model()`
- `poker/character_images.py`: `get_image_provider()`, `get_image_model()`

Each `GamePersistence.__init__` opens multiple DB connections (WAL mode, init schema, check migrations). These functions are called during game creation and AI image generation, causing unnecessary DB connection overhead.

## Changes

1. **`flask_app/config.py`**: Added `@lru_cache(maxsize=1)` helper `_get_config_persistence()` that returns a shared `GamePersistence` instance. All 4 config getters now call this instead of constructing new instances.

2. **`poker/character_images.py`**: Added the same `@lru_cache(maxsize=1)` helper `_get_image_config_persistence()`. Both `get_image_provider()` and `get_image_model()` now use this shared instance.

## Test

`tests/test_triage_t2_05.py`:
- Verifies `GamePersistence` is constructed only once across multiple calls to config getters in `flask_app/config.py`
- Verifies `GamePersistence` is constructed only once across multiple calls to image config getters in `poker/character_images.py`
- Verifies the cached instance is shared (same object identity)
