# T1-15: Install react-hot-toast, add Toaster to App.tsx

## Problem
No notification/toast system exists. API errors are logged to console only, giving users no visible feedback when operations fail.

## Changes

### `react/react/package.json`
- Added `react-hot-toast` (`^2.4.1`) to dependencies

### `react/react/src/App.tsx`
- Imported `Toaster` from `react-hot-toast`
- Added `<Toaster />` component at the root level (inside the fragment, before `<Routes>`)
- Configured with `position: "top-right"` and `duration: 4000` (4 seconds)

## Usage Pattern
Any component can now trigger a toast notification:
```tsx
import toast from 'react-hot-toast';

toast.success('Game created!');
toast.error('Failed to create game.');
toast('Hello!');
```

## Test
A test file (`react/react/src/__tests__/Toast.test.tsx`) is provided but requires vitest/jest setup to run. The test verifies that `<Toaster />` renders and that `toast()` can be called.

## Notes
- This is a prerequisite for T1-13 (loading/error states) and T1-14 (offline detection)
- Docker rebuild required to install the npm dependency
