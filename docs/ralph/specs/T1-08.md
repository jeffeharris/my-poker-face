# T1-08: `get_next_active_player_idx` returns inactive player

## Problem

`get_next_active_player_idx` in `poker/poker_game.py:618-645` is supposed to find the next active player after a given index. When no active player is found (the loop wraps all the way around), it returns `starting_idx` — which may itself be an inactive player. This violates the function's contract and could cause:

- Betting rounds starting with inactive (folded/all-in/eliminated) players
- Eliminated players set as dealer
- Silent logic errors propagating through game state

## Caller Analysis

1. **`set_betting_round_start_player` (line 562, 565)**: Called at the start of each betting round. If all players are inactive, the betting round shouldn't start — the state machine should have already detected the hand is over.

2. **`advance_to_next_active_player` (line 651)**: Called to move to the next player during betting. If all players are inactive, the betting round should have ended via `is_betting_round_complete`.

3. **Dealer assignment in `start_next_hand` (line 733)**: Called after resetting players for a new hand. Players with zero chips are removed after this call (line 739), so there should always be at least one active player at this point.

In all cases, having zero active players when this function is called indicates a broken invariant in the state machine. The correct response is to fail loudly with a ValueError.

## Fix

Changed line 643 from `return starting_idx` to `raise ValueError("No active players found")`. This matches the already-documented `raises ValueError` in the docstring that was never implemented.

## Test

`tests/test_triage_T1_08.py` verifies:
1. Normal operation: finds next active player correctly
2. Wraps around the player list
3. Raises ValueError when all players are inactive (folded/all-in)
4. Skips folded/all-in players correctly
