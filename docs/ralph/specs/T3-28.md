# T3-28: Set `--max-warnings=0` in CI

## Problem

The GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` line 57 allowed 50 lint warnings:

```yaml
run: npm run lint -- --max-warnings=50
```

This permissive threshold lets warnings accumulate over time. A clean codebase should enforce zero warnings to prevent gradual degradation.

## What Changed

Changed line 57 in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` from:
```yaml
run: npm run lint -- --max-warnings=50
```

To:
```yaml
run: npm run lint -- --max-warnings=0
```

## Context

This change is safe to make after T2-12 which removed debug console.log statements from the React codebase. The logger utility created in that task properly gates debug output, and the codebase should now pass lint with zero warnings.

## Verification

No test file needed for this config change. The CI pipeline itself will verify that lint passes with zero warnings on the next PR/push to main.
