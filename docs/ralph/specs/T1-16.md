# T1-16: Replace predictable game IDs with secrets.token_urlsafe(16)

## Problem
`generate_game_id()` in `flask_app/routes/game_routes.py` used `str(int(time.time() * 1000))` to create game IDs. These are sequential, predictable timestamp-based values that an attacker could enumerate to find valid game IDs.

## What Changed
- Added `import secrets` to `flask_app/routes/game_routes.py`
- Replaced `str(int(time.time() * 1000))` with `secrets.token_urlsafe(16)` which produces a 22-character URL-safe random string

## Verification
- Database schema already defines `game_id` as TEXT — no migration needed
- No code in the codebase assumes game IDs are numeric (no `parseInt`, `Number()`, or `int()` on game_id)
- TypeScript types already use `string` for game IDs
- The `str(game_id)` call at line 1207 is harmless (string of a string is still a string)

## Test
`tests/test_generate_game_id.py` verifies:
- IDs are non-empty strings
- 100 generated IDs are all unique
- IDs are not sequential/time-based (no purely numeric output)
- IDs are URL-safe (only alphanumeric, hyphen, underscore)
