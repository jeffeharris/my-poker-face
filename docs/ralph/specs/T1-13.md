# T1-13: Add loading/error states to handleQuickPlay with toasts

## Problem
`handleQuickPlay` and `handleStartCustomGame` in `App.tsx` catch errors but only log to `console.error`. When a game creation fails, the user sees nothing — the loading overlay disappears and no feedback is given. Non-ok responses (other than max games limit) are also silently ignored.

## Changes
- Import `toast` from `react-hot-toast` (already available via T1-15)
- In `handleQuickPlay` catch block: show `toast.error('Failed to create game. Please try again.')`
- In `handleQuickPlay` non-ok response handling: show error from response body via `toast.error(data.error || ...)`
- Apply same pattern to `handleStartCustomGame`
- Loading state (`isCreatingGame`) was already correctly managed in all paths via `finally` blocks

## Files Modified
- `react/react/src/App.tsx` — added toast notifications to error paths in `handleQuickPlay` and `handleStartCustomGame`

## Test
No runtime test infrastructure exists for React components yet. The fix is verified by TypeScript compilation (`npx tsc --noEmit`). The changes are mechanical: adding `toast.error()` calls alongside existing `console.error()` calls.
