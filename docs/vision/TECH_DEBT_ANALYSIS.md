# Technical Debt Analysis Plan

## Overview
Before implementing the ambitious features outlined in our vision documents, we need to ensure the foundation is solid. This document outlines the approach for analyzing technical debt in the My Poker Face codebase.

## Analysis Steps

### 1. Architecture Review
**Goal**: Verify the codebase follows its stated functional/immutable design patterns

**What to check**:
- Consistent application of functional/immutable state pattern
- Look for hidden state mutations
- Separation of concerns (game logic vs UI vs AI)
- Module dependencies and circular imports
- Clear boundaries between layers

**Red flags**:
- State mutations in supposedly immutable objects
- Business logic in UI components
- Circular dependencies
- God objects or modules doing too much

### 2. Code Quality Scan
**Goal**: Identify maintainability issues

**What to check**:
- Code duplication across modules
- Function complexity (cyclomatic complexity > 10)
- Dead code and unused imports
- Naming convention consistency
- TODO/FIXME comments indicating known issues

**Tools to consider**:
- pylint, flake8 for Python
- ESLint for JavaScript
- Coverage.py for test coverage

### 3. State Management Audit
**Goal**: Ensure game state is managed consistently and safely

**What to check**:
- Single source of truth for game state
- State validation at boundaries
- Atomic state transitions
- State serialization/deserialization
- WebSocket state synchronization

**Critical questions**:
- Can we add new state fields without breaking existing code?
- Is state properly versioned for save games?
- How is state synchronized across clients?

### 4. Error Handling Review
**Goal**: Ensure system degrades gracefully

**What to check**:
- Unhandled exceptions (especially in AI calls)
- Error propagation patterns
- User-facing error messages
- Logging and debugging capabilities
- Recovery strategies for failed operations

**Key areas**:
- AI API failures
- WebSocket disconnections
- Invalid game states
- Malformed user input

### 5. Testing Coverage & Quality
**Goal**: Understand what's tested and what isn't

**What to check**:
- Unit test coverage percentage
- Integration test presence
- AI behavior testability
- Test quality (not just coverage)
- Mock strategies for external dependencies

**Critical gaps to identify**:
- Untested game state transitions
- No tests for AI personality features
- Missing error scenario tests
- No performance benchmarks

### 6. Performance Analysis
**Goal**: Identify current and potential bottlenecks

**What to check**:
- AI API call patterns (blocking vs async)
- State copying overhead in functional approach
- Memory usage patterns
- WebSocket message frequency
- JSON parsing/serialization costs

**Potential issues**:
- Multiple sequential AI calls
- Large personality JSON files
- Inefficient state updates
- Memory leaks in long sessions

### 7. Dependency Health Check
**Goal**: Ensure dependencies are maintainable

**What to check**:
- Package versions and updates available
- Security vulnerabilities (pip audit)
- License compatibility
- Coupling to specific providers
- Deprecated package usage

**Key dependencies to review**:
- Flask/Flask-SocketIO scalability
- OpenAI client flexibility
- Frontend framework choices

## Critical Questions for New Features

### For Personality Elasticity
1. Can we add elasticity data to personalities without breaking existing ones?
2. Is the state update mechanism efficient enough for frequent trait changes?
3. How do we persist elasticity state between sessions?

### For Multi-Model AI Support
1. How tightly coupled is the code to OpenAI's API?
2. Can we abstract the AI interface cleanly?
3. What assumptions about response format exist?

### For Social Features (Chat/Relationships)
1. Can WebSocket handle increased message volume?
2. How do we store relationship data efficiently?
3. Is there a clean way to add persistent player profiles?

### For Tournament Mode
1. Can the state machine handle multiple simultaneous games?
2. How do we simulate other tables efficiently?
3. What's the memory cost of tracking tournament state?

## Debt Priority Matrix

### üö® Critical (Block new features)
- State mutations in immutable system
- No error handling for AI failures
- Circular dependencies
- Security vulnerabilities

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important (Address soon)
- Poor test coverage of core systems
- Tight coupling to single AI provider
- Inefficient state management
- No migration strategy for data models

### üìù Nice to Have (Address eventually)
- Code style inconsistencies
- Minor performance optimizations
- Better logging/debugging tools
- Documentation gaps

## Analysis Output Format

After analysis, create a report with:

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Overall health score (A-F)
   - Critical issues count
   - Estimated remediation time

2. **Detailed Findings**
   - Issue description
   - Impact on new features
   - Remediation approach
   - Effort estimate

3. **Remediation Roadmap**
   - Quick wins (< 1 day)
   - Critical fixes (1-3 days)
   - Major refactors (1+ week)

4. **Risk Assessment**
   - What happens if we don't fix?
   - What could break with new features?
   - Technical debt interest rate

## Next Steps

1. Perform the analysis following this plan
2. Create remediation tickets/tasks
3. Decide on "fix first" vs "fix as we go"
4. Update architecture docs based on findings

This analysis will ensure we build our ambitious features on a solid foundation rather than accumulating more debt.
