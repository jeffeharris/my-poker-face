# Poker Vocabulary by Gate

Terms grouped by when they should be introduced in the coaching progression.
Each gate builds on the previous — by the time a player reaches Gate 4, they
should have absorbed all earlier vocabulary through natural coaching interactions.

---

## Gate 0 — Tutorial / Rules

Terms a player needs to understand the basic mechanics of the game.
These are taught during onboarding or the tutorial, before coaching begins.

### The Game
| Term | Plain English |
|---|---|
| Hand | One round of poker, from dealing cards to someone winning the pot |
| Deal | When the cards are given out to each player |
| Deck | The 52 cards used in the game |
| Pot | All the chips bet so far — the prize for winning |
| Showdown | When remaining players reveal their cards to see who wins |
| Muck | Throwing your cards away without showing them |

### The Cards
| Term | Plain English |
|---|---|
| Hole cards | Your two private cards that only you can see |
| Community cards | The shared cards in the middle that everyone uses |
| Suit | Hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades |
| Rank | The number or face on the card (2 through Ace) |
| Suited | Two cards of the same suit |
| Offsuit | Two cards of different suits |
| Kicker | Your next-best card, used to break ties |

### Poker Notation

Shorthand that poker players use to write about hands quickly. The coaching
system uses this notation internally and players will see it in the UI.

| Notation | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| A, K, Q, J, T | Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten | T = 10 |
| 2–9 | Number cards written as-is | 7 = seven |
| s | Suited — both cards are the same suit | AKs = Ace-King suited |
| o | Offsuit — cards are different suits | AKo = Ace-King offsuit |
| No letter | Pocket pair (both cards same rank) | QQ = pocket queens |
| Higher card first | The bigger card is always written first | KTs, not TKs |

**Common examples:**

| Written | Spoken | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| AA | "Pocket aces" | Two aces |
| AKs | "Ace-king suited" | Ace and king of the same suit |
| AKo | "Ace-king offsuit" | Ace and king of different suits |
| AK | "Ace-king" | Either suited or offsuit |
| T9s | "Ten-nine suited" | Ten and nine of the same suit |
| 72o | "Seven-deuce offsuit" | The worst starting hand in poker |
| JJ | "Pocket jacks" | Two jacks |
| KQs | "King-queen suited" | King and queen of the same suit |

**Card notation (specific cards):**

| Symbol | Suit |
|---|---|
| h | Hearts (♥) |
| d | Diamonds (♦) |
| c | Clubs (♣) |
| s | Spades (♠) |

So `Ah` = Ace of hearts, `Td` = Ten of diamonds, `2c` = Two of clubs.

**Gate note:** Beginners should see "Ace and King of the same suit" in the UI.
By Gate 2, the coach can start using "AKs" and the player will know what it
means. The notation is a Gate 1–2 vocabulary item — simple enough to pick up
early, and the coach sees their cards anyway so it's reinforced every hand.

### The Actions

| Bet | Put chips in when no one else has bet yet |
| Raise | Increase someone else's bet |
| All-in | Bet all your remaining chips |
| Re-raise | Raise after someone has already raised |

### The Streets
| Term | Plain English |
|---|---|
| Preflop | Before any community cards are dealt — you only see your two cards |
| Flop | The first three community cards, dealt together |
| Turn | The fourth community card |
| River | The fifth and final community card |
| Street | A general term for any betting round (preflop, flop, turn, river) |

| BB (as a unit) | Big blinds used to measure bet sizes and stack depth (e.g., "I have 50 BB") |
| Stakes | The blind levels of a game (e.g., $1/$2 means $1 small blind, $2 big blind) |
| Buy-in | The amount of chips you start with or pay to enter a tournament |

### Hand Rankings

|---|---|
| High card | No combination — your best single card plays |
| Pair | Two cards of the same rank |
| Two pair | Two different pairs |
| Three of a kind | Three cards of the same rank |
| Straight | Five cards in numerical order (e.g., 5-6-7-8-9) |

## Gate 1 — Preflop Fundamentals

Terms the coach introduces while teaching hand selection and basic decisions.

| Big slick | Ace-King (AK) |
| Bullets | Pocket aces (AA) |
| Cowboys | Pocket kings (KK) |
| Ladies | Pocket queens (QQ) |
| Hooks / Fishhooks | Pocket jacks (JJ) |

### Position
| Term | Abbreviation | Plain English |
|---|---|---|
| Position | — | Where you sit relative to the dealer — affects when you act |
| Early position | EP | First few players to act (harder — less information) |
| Late position | LP | Last few players to act (easier — you've seen what others did) |
| Middle position | MP | Between early and late |
| Under the gun | UTG | The first player to act preflop (right after the big blind) |
| UTG+1 | UTG+1 | Second player to act preflop |
| Lojack | LJ | Two seats right of the button (6-max: same as UTG) |
| Hijack | HJ | Three seats right of the button |
| Cutoff | CO | One seat before the button — second-best position |
| Button | BTN | The dealer position — last to act post-flop (best seat) |
| Small blind | SB | Left of the button — acts first post-flop (worst position) |
| Big blind | BB | Left of the small blind — last preflop, early post-flop |

**How positions change by table size:**

| Position | 9-handed | 6-handed (6-max) | Heads up (2 players) |
|---|---|---|---|
| SB | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (also the button) |
| BB | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| UTG | ✓ | ✓ (also LJ) | — |
| UTG+1 | ✓ | — | — |
| MP | ✓ | — | — |
| LJ | ✓ | — | — |
| HJ | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| CO | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| BTN | ✓ | ✓ | — |

**Key concept:** Positions are relative, not fixed. As players are eliminated,
positions compress. In a 4-player game you effectively only have BTN, SB, BB,
and UTG. The names matter less than understanding "am I acting early or late?"

**Acting order:**
- **Preflop**: UTG acts first → around to BB (blinds act last)
- **Post-flop**: SB acts first → around to BTN (button acts last)

**Why the button is the best seat:**

The button (dealer position) is the most profitable seat in poker because:

1. **Last to act post-flop** — you see what everyone else does before you
   decide. If they check, you can bet. If they bet, you can fold cheaply.
2. **Information advantage** — every action gives you data. By the time it's
   your turn, you know who's interested and who's weak.
3. **Pot control** — you decide the final action on every street. You can
   check back to keep the pot small or bet to grow it.
4. **Wider range** — because of these advantages, you can play more hands
   profitably from the button than any other position.

Professional players win the most money from the button and lose the most
from the blinds. That's not luck — it's the structural advantage of acting
last.

The `position_matters` skill teaches this: tighter ranges from early
position (you're acting blind), wider from the button (you have the edge).

### Basic Concepts
| Term | Plain English |
|---|---|
| Limp | Just calling the big blind preflop instead of raising |
| Open raise | The first raise preflop |
| Hand range | The set of hands you'd play in a given situation (see below) |
| Tight | Playing fewer hands, being selective |
| Loose | Playing many hands, being less selective |
| Open | To make the first raise preflop ("open the pot") |
| Fold around | Everyone folds to you — no one has entered the pot |
| Limp behind | Calling the big blind after someone else has already limped |

**Hand ranges explained:**

A range is all the hands you'd play in a specific spot. Ranges are usually
expressed as percentages or lists:

| Range | Meaning | Roughly |
|---|---|---|
| Top 5% | Only the very best hands | AA, KK, QQ, AKs |
| Top 10% | Premium and strong hands | Add JJ, TT, AQs, AKo |
| Top 20% | Good hands | Add 99-77, AJs, KQs, AQo |
| Top 35% | Playable hands | Add most suited connectors, suited aces, broadways |
| Top 50%+ | Very loose | Playing most hands |

Your range should be tighter in early position (top 10–15%) and wider in
late position (top 30–40%) because acting last gives you more information.

The coaching system classifies hands into tiers: Premium (top 5%),
Top 10, Top 20, Top 35 (playable), and Trash (below top 35%).
These thresholds drive the `fold_trash_hands` and `position_matters` skills.

## Gate 3 — Pressure Recognition

Terms for understanding odds, opponent behavior, and betting dynamics.

### Odds & Math
| Term | Plain English |
|---|---|
| Pot odds | The ratio of the current pot to the cost of calling (see below) |
| Implied odds | Expected future winnings if you hit your draw |
| Equity | Your percentage chance of winning the hand |
| Expected value (EV) | The average amount you win or lose on a decision over time |
| +EV / -EV | A profitable / unprofitable decision long-term |
| Breakeven equity | The minimum equity needed for a call to be profitable |
| Pot committed | You've put in so many chips that folding wastes too much |
| Odds | A way of expressing probability (e.g., 4:1 means 1 in 5 chance) |
| Rule of 2 and 4 | Quick equity math — multiply outs by 2 (one card) or 4 (two cards) |

**Pot odds explained:**

Pot odds tell you whether calling a bet is mathematically worth it.

```
Pot odds = pot size / cost to call
```

Example: The pot is $100 and your opponent bets $50. The pot is now $150
and it costs you $50 to call.

```
Pot odds = $150 / $50 = 3:1
```

You need to win more than 1 in 4 times (25%) for calling to be profitable.
If your equity (chance of winning) is above 25%, calling is +EV.

**Quick reference:**

| Opponent bets | Pot odds | You need at least |
|---|---|---|
| 25% of pot | 5:1 | 17% equity |
| 33% of pot (third) | 4:1 | 20% equity |
| 50% of pot (half) | 3:1 | 25% equity |
| 75% of pot | 2.3:1 | 30% equity |
| 100% of pot (full) | 2:1 | 33% equity |
| 150% of pot (overbet) | 1.7:1 | 37% equity |

**Rule of 2 and 4 — quick equity from outs:**

| Outs | One card to come (×2) | Two cards to come (×4) | Example draw |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | ~8% | ~16% | Gutshot straight draw |
| 8 | ~16% | ~32% | Open-ended straight draw |
| 9 | ~18% | ~36% | Flush draw |
| 12 | ~24% | ~48% | Flush draw + gutshot |
| 15 | ~30% | ~60% | Flush draw + open-ended straight |

The `draws_need_price` skill uses this: it compares your equity (from outs)
against the required equity (from pot odds) to evaluate whether calling is correct.

**Outs explained:**

Outs are the cards remaining in the deck that complete your draw or improve
your hand enough to win. Counting outs is the foundation of poker math.

Examples on the flop (with two cards to come):

| Your hand | Board | Draw | Outs | Cards that help |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 9♥ 8♥ | 7♣ 6♦ K♠ | Open-ended straight | 8 | Any 5 (×4) + any T (×4) |
| A♠ J♠ | K♠ 7♠ 2♦ | Flush draw | 9 | Any remaining spade (13 − 4 = 9) |
| A♠ J♠ | K♠ T♠ 2♦ | Flush draw + gutshot | 12 | 9 spades + 3 non-spade queens |
| Q♥ J♦ | T♣ 8♠ 3♥ | Gutshot straight | 4 | Any 9 (×4) |
| 5♣ 5♦ | K♥ 9♠ 3♣ | Set draw (pocket pair) | 2 | Remaining two 5s |
| A♦ K♦ | 7♣ 4♠ 2♥ | Overcards only | 6 | Any A (×3) + any K (×3) |

**What counts as an out:**
- Cards that make a flush, straight, set, or better — these are clean outs
- Cards that pair your hole card — technically improve your hand but often
  not enough to win (the coaching system's draw detection ignores these to
  avoid inflating the count)

**What doesn't count:**
- Cards that improve your hand but also improve your opponent more
  (e.g., making a straight when a flush is possible — "tainted outs")
- Cards already dealt to other players (see "unseen cards" below)

**Unseen cards:**

In poker you can only see your own hole cards and the community cards.
Opponents' cards are hidden. When counting outs or calculating equity,
we treat all unseen cards as if they could equally be any remaining card
in the deck.

| What you can see | What you can't see |
|---|---|
| Your 2 hole cards | Opponents' hole cards |
| Community cards (0–5) | Undealt deck cards |
| | Mucked (folded) cards |

With 2 hole cards and 3 community cards (flop), there are 52 − 5 = 47
unseen cards. Your 9 flush outs are somewhere in those 47 cards, so your
chance of hitting on the next card is 9/47 ≈ 19%.

Mucked cards are technically gone from the deck, but since you don't know
what they were, mathematically they don't change your odds. The calculation
stays the same whether those cards would have helped you or not.

**Equity explained:**

Equity is your share of the pot based on your probability of winning. If you
have 40% equity in a $200 pot, your expected share is $80.

| Situation | Typical equity | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| AA vs KK preflop | ~82% vs ~18% | Aces are a huge favorite |
| AKs vs QQ preflop | ~46% vs ~54% | Classic coin-flip matchup |
| Flush draw on flop | ~35% | Roughly 1 in 3 chance to hit |
| Overpair vs two overcards | ~70% vs ~30% | Pair is ahead but vulnerable |
| Set vs flush draw on flop | ~65% vs ~35% | Set is strong but not safe |
| Top pair vs air | ~85%+ | Heavily favored |

Equity changes on every street. A flush draw has ~35% equity on the flop
(two cards to come) but only ~18% on the turn (one card to come). This is
why draws get more expensive to chase on later streets.

The coaching system computes equity using Monte Carlo simulation (running
thousands of random outcomes) and displays it as a percentage.

**Expected Value (EV) explained:**

EV is the average profit or loss of a decision if you made it thousands of
times. It strips away luck and tells you if a play is fundamentally good
or bad.

```
EV of calling = (equity × pot you'd win) − ((1 − equity) × cost to call)
```

Example: Pot is $100, opponent bets $50, you have a flush draw (~35% equity).

```
Pot if you call and win = $100 + $50 + $50 = $200
EV = (0.35 × $200) − (0.65 × $50)
EV = $70 − $32.50
EV = +$37.50
```

This call is +EV — you profit $37.50 on average. Even though you'll lose
65% of the time, the times you win pay enough to make up for it.

| EV | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| +EV (positive) | Profitable long-term | Make this play |
| −EV (negative) | Unprofitable long-term | Avoid this play |
| 0 EV (breakeven) | Neither wins nor loses over time | Marginal — other factors decide |

**Key insight:** A single hand's result doesn't tell you if a decision was
good. You can make a +EV call and lose. You can make a −EV call and win.
EV measures the decision, not the outcome.

**Breakeven equity explained:**

Breakeven equity is the minimum equity you need for a call to be +EV. If
your actual equity is above this number, call. If it's below, fold.

```
Breakeven equity = cost to call / (pot + cost to call)
```

Example: Pot is $100, opponent bets $50.

```
Breakeven equity = $50 / ($150 + $50) = $50 / $200 = 25%
```

You need at least 25% equity to call profitably.

**Quick reference (same as pot odds table, different angle):**

| Opponent bets | Total pot after call | Breakeven equity |
|---|---|---|
| 25% of pot | Pot × 1.5 | 17% |
| 33% of pot | Pot × 1.67 | 20% |
| 50% of pot | Pot × 2 | 25% |
| 75% of pot | Pot × 2.5 | 30% |
| 100% of pot | Pot × 3 | 33% |
| 200% of pot | Pot × 5 | 40% |

**How they all connect:**

```
Outs → Equity (rule of 2 and 4)
Pot odds → Breakeven equity
Equity vs Breakeven equity → EV of calling

If your equity > breakeven equity → call is +EV → call
If your equity < breakeven equity → call is −EV → fold
```

This is the complete decision framework for the `draws_need_price` skill.
The coach teaches it in layers: first just "you need a good draw to call,"
then gradually introduces the math as the player advances through gates.

## Usage Notes

- Terms should be introduced naturally in coaching prompts, not as vocabulary
  lists. The coach uses a term, and the context makes it clear what it means.
- If the coach's language adjustment tool detects the player doesn't know a
  term, it drops down and uses the plain English version instead.
- When a player advances to a new gate, the coach can explicitly bridge
