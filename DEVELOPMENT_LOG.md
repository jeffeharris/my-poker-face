# Development Log - Rich CLI Poker Game

## Summary of Work Completed

### ✅ Accomplished

1. **Created Rich CLI Interface**
   - Beautiful terminal UI using Rich library
   - ASCII art title and menus
   - Unicode card rendering (♠♥♦♣)
   - Table layout with panels and live updates
   - Personality selection screens

2. **Fixed Game Integration Issues**
   - Created GameAdapterV2 to properly interface with poker engine
   - Fixed all attribute errors (current_player_idx, highest_bet, pot structure)
   - Implemented proper dataclass updates using replace()
   - Fixed action mappings (e.g., "all-in" vs "all_in")

3. **Added Mock AI System**
   - Created MockAIController for testing without OpenAI
   - AI makes random but sensible decisions
   - Personality-specific responses without API calls
   - Allows game to run fully offline

4. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Created test suite with 7 tests
   - Tests cover: initialization, actions, AI decisions, betting rounds, folding, all-in, hand completion
   - Created full game test script that plays complete hands
   - All core game flow tests passing

5. **Game Runner Implementation**
   - Main menu with Quick Game and Choose Opponents options
   - Personality showcase with traits and catchphrases
   - Game loop with proper error handling
   - AI thinking animations and personality messages

### 🐛 Issues Fixed

1. **Import Errors**: Fixed poker module imports and dependencies
2. **State Management**: Proper handling of frozen dataclasses
3. **Action Processing**: Bypass complex PokerAction class for direct state updates
4. **Player Updates**: Use dataclasses.replace() instead of _replace()
5. **Pot Structure**: Handle pot as dict with 'total' key
6. **Current Bet**: Use highest_bet property instead of current_bet field

### 📝 Known Limitations

1. **Player Name**: Human player is hardcoded as "Jeff" in poker engine
2. **Hand Evaluation**: Winner determination is simplified (random selection)
3. **Side Pots**: Not implemented for all-in situations
4. **New Hands**: Start new hand functionality needs work
5. **Persistence**: No save/load game functionality

### 🎮 Game Status

The game is now **PLAYABLE**! You can:
- Start a game with 2 AI opponents
- Play through complete hands
- See AI personalities in action
- Win/lose chips
- Experience the full poker flow (pre-flop → flop → turn → river → showdown)

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. Implement proper hand evaluation using HandEvaluator
2. Fix "Jeff" hardcoding issue
3. Add new hand functionality
4. Implement side pots for all-in situations
5. Add game statistics and leaderboards
6. Polish animations and UI transitions

## Running the Game

```bash
# Basic run
python -m fresh_ui

# Or use the helper script
./play_game.py

# Run tests
python -m pytest fresh_ui/tests/test_game_flow.py -v

# Test full game flow
python test_full_game.py
```

The game works with or without an OpenAI API key, making it accessible for everyone!
