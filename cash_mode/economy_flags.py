"""Cash-mode economy toggles — central place for A/B-able knobs.

These exist so we can experiment with closing the chip universe (or
balancing the faucet against the sink) without rewriting call sites.
Three independent variables:

  - `REGEN_ENABLED`: the passive faucet. When False, `project_bankroll`
    returns stored chips verbatim — AIs no longer accrue chips while
    idle. **Default False** as of CASH_MODE_SIDE_HUSTLE.md: passive regen
    is retired in favour of the active side hustle (`SIDE_HUSTLE_ENABLED`),
    where broke AIs go off-grid to earn a pool-funded lump. The
    projection machinery is kept (flip back to True to A/B the old
    passive faucet), but production runs with it off.

  - `SIDE_HUSTLE_ENABLED`: the active faucet that replaces passive regen.
    When True, broke AIs (those who can't afford to play) are sent to an
    off-grid side hustle on lobby refresh and return with a lump drawn
    from the bank pool. See `cash_mode/ai_side_hustle.py`.

  - `RAKE_ENABLED`: the table-side sink. When True, a fraction of every
    pot is destroyed (ledger reason `table_rake`, sink = central_bank)
    at award time. Default off so the live deployment behaviour is
    unchanged until we flip it.

  - `RAKE_PLAYER_TABLES`: when False, rake only fires at AI-only sim
    tables (`cash_mode/full_sim.play_one_hand`). When True, the same
    rake also applies at tables with a human seated. Keeping this off
    preserves the "sandbox" feel for players.

  - `RAKE_STAKE_BIG_BLINDS`: the stake tiers rake applies at, keyed by
    big blind (the 1:1 proxy for a stake label — see
    `cash_mode/stakes_ladder.STAKES_LADDER`). Tier-keyed, not table-keyed,
    so any number of tables at a listed stake rake identically (one $1000
    table or ten, present or future). Default `{1000}` — only the top
    tier rakes, which throttles pool inflow at the high-volume low stakes.
    Add a big blind to the set to rake another tier.

Tuning levers:

  - `RAKE_RATE`: fraction of pot destroyed per hand. 0.02 = 2%.
  - `RAKE_CAP_BB`: hard cap on rake per hand, expressed in big blinds.
    Mirrors the cap real cardrooms enforce so a single huge pot can't
    delete half the universe.

All values are module-level globals so tests can monkeypatch them
without plumbing config objects through. Production deployments can
override via a startup hook if/when we want runtime control.

# --- Faucet ---------------------------------------------------------------

# hustle is the replacement faucet. Flip back to True only to A/B the old
# passive-accrual behaviour; production runs with it off.

# --- Vice mode (mutually-exclusive 3-state toggle) ------------------------

# Which vice mechanism (if any) drains rich AIs into the bank pool.
# Exactly one of `VICE_MODES` — a single value, so the two mechanisms can
# never both run (the double-drain bug) or silently both be off:
#
#   'real' — the live, LLM-narrated vice (`vice_spending`). Rich AIs go
#            off-grid with character narration + one-shot psych recovery.
#            Needs a vice_repo + an LLM call per fire → the production
#            setting. See `cash_mode/ai_vice_spending.py`.
#   'fake' — the LLM-free / psych-free stub (`bank_pool_deposit`) for
#            sims + testbeds that can't afford an LLM call per tick. Same
#            chip drain, no narration / off-grid / recovery. See
#            `resolve_fake_vice_deposits` in `cash_mode/closed_economy.py`.
#   'off'  — no vice; the pool is fed only by table rake (+ casino returns).
#
# `refresh_unseated_tables` reads this (overridable per-call via its
# `vice_mode` kwarg); the sim forces 'fake' since real vice can't run
# without an LLM. The real-vice *expiry* pass always runs regardless of
# mode, so existing off-grid AIs still return when the mode is switched.
