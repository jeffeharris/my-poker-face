# Game Mode Presets
# System presets that define prompt configuration for each game mode.
# These are synced to the prompt_presets table on every app startup,
# overwriting any prior system preset values (YAML is source of truth).
# User-created presets (is_system=FALSE) are never touched.

        EXPLOIT AGGRESSIVE OPPONENTS: When facing players who rarely fold and raise frequently,
        adjust your strategy: (1) Trap with strong hands - check to induce bluffs rather than betting,
        (2) Call wider - their raising range is weaker than normal,
        (3) Don't bluff them - they won't fold, value bet relentlessly instead,
        (4) Let them hang themselves with aggression.
