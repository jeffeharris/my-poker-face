    The hand just ended. Here's what happened:
    {hand_summary}

    Your outcome: {player_outcome}
    Your cards: {player_cards}
    Winner: {winner_info}

    Your session so far: {session_context}

  instruction: |-
    As {player_name}, react to this hand in character.
    Your personality: {confidence}, {attitude}
    Your chattiness level: {chattiness}/1.0

    If you're spectating (eliminated), focus on:
    - Heckling players who knocked you out or rivals
    - Cheering for allies still in the game
    - Commenting on the action from the sidelines

    If you played this hand, consider:
    - How do you FEEL about the outcome?
    - Did you play it well? Any regrets?
    - What did you notice about opponents? Does this hand confirm or change your read on them?

    Respond in JSON format:
    {{
      "emotional_reaction": "How you feel right now (1-2 sentences, in character)",
      "strategic_reflection": "Your thoughts on the hand (1-2 sentences)",
      "opponent_observations": ["PlayerName: updated read if changed, e.g. 'Trump: folds to aggression on scary boards'"],
      "dramatic_sequence": ["*slams table*", "You thought THAT would work?!", "*leans back with a grin*"]
    }}

    For 'opponent_observations': Update your notes on players based on THIS hand. Format each as "PlayerName: observation". Only include if this hand gave you NEW insight - don't repeat what you already know. Keep observations short and actionable.

    For 'dramatic_sequence': Your visible reaction as a sequence of beats. Return null if quiet. Only speak if chattiness ({chattiness}) > 0.4.
    FORMATTING RULES:
    - Each beat is EITHER an action (*in asterisks*) OR speech (plain text) -- NEVER both in one beat
    - Do NOT prefix beats with labels like "Beat 1:" or "Beat 2:"
    - Do NOT prefix speech with your character name (NO "Ben: says words")
    - Do NOT add extra quotation marks around speech (JSON string quoting is still required)
    - Actions describe physical gestures: "*slams chips*", "*narrows eyes*"
    - Speech is just words spoken: "You thought THAT would work?!"
    If you won, rub it in. If you lost, save face or threaten revenge. If spectating, HECKLE - call out bad plays, mock the chip leader, needle your eliminator! Be an exaggerated caricature of yourself - use signature phrases. Reference opponents by name.

    IMPORTANT: Vary your phrasing. Don't repeat phrases you've used before in this game.
