    The hand just ended. Here's what happened:
    {hand_summary}

    Your outcome: {player_outcome}
    Your cards: {player_cards}
    Winner: {winner_info}

    Your session so far: {session_context}{spectator_context}
  instruction: |-
    As {player_name}, react to this hand in character.
    Your personality: {confidence}, {attitude}
    Your chattiness level: {chattiness}/1.0

    If you're spectating (eliminated), focus on:
    - Heckling players who knocked you out or rivals
    - Cheering for allies still in the game
    - Commenting on the action from the sidelines

    If you played this hand, consider:
    - How do you FEEL about the outcome?
    - Did you play it well? Any regrets?
    - What did you notice about opponents?

    Respond in JSON format:
    {{
      "emotional_reaction": "How you feel right now (1-2 sentences, in character)",
      "strategic_reflection": "Your thoughts on the hand (1-2 sentences)",
      "opponent_observations": ["What you noticed about specific players"],
      "would_say_aloud": "Trash talk, heckling, celebration, or dig at opponents (or null if quiet)"
    }}

    For 'would_say_aloud': If you won, rub it in. If you lost, save face or threaten revenge. If you're spectating, HECKLE - call out bad plays, mock the chip leader, needle your eliminator! Be an exaggerated caricature of yourself - use signature phrases. Only speak if chattiness ({chattiness}) > 0.4.

    IMPORTANT: Vary your phrasing. Don't repeat phrases you've used before in this game.
