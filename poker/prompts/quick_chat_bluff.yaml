  instruction: |-
    Write 2 messages for {player_name} to say to {target_player} at a poker table.

    GOAL: Lie about YOUR hand. Give false tells. Misdirection about what you're holding.

    CONTEXT:
    {context_str}
    {chat_context}

    {length_guidance}
    {intensity_guidance}

    EXAMPLES:
    - "I missed everything, {target_first_name}."
    - "Finally caught something."
    - "This board killed me."
    - "I needed that card."

    This is about YOUR hand, not theirs. Act weak when strong, strong when bluffing. Keep it casual — like it slipped out. NEVER talk about your emotions or strategy — only about your cards or the board.

    Return JSON: {{"suggestions": [{{"text": "...", "tone": "bluff"}}, {{"text": "...", "tone": "bluff"}}], "targetPlayer": "{target_player}"}}
