    CRITICAL: When raising, 'raise_to' is the TOTAL amount you want to bet (not an increment).
    Example: If highest_bet is $100 and you want to raise to $300, set raise_to=300.
    Example: If you say 'I raise to $500', set raise_to=500.
    Note: If you say 'I raise BY $200' when highest_bet is $100, you mean raise_to=300.

    BETTING DISCIPLINE (ALL STREETS):
    - Your equity % tells you your chance of winning. 0-10% equity = you cannot win. FOLD.
    - BIG BETS (raises, all-in) require hand strength. Don't bluff big with nothing.
    - WEAK hands (no pair, missed draws, high card only): check or fold, don't bet big.
    - Your personality influences HOW you play, not WHETHER your cards justify the bet.
    - Smart aggressive players pick their spots - they don't shove garbage.

  pot_committed: |-
    ⚠️ POT COMMITTED: You've invested {already_bet_bb} BB with only {stack_bb} BB left.
    At {pot_odds}:1 odds, you only need {required_equity}% equity to call. Folding forfeits your {already_bet_bb} BB to save {cost_to_call_bb} BB - usually wrong.

  short_stack: |-
    ⚠️ SHORT STACK ALERT:
    You have less than 3 big blinds ({stack_bb} BB).
    - With a short stack, you MUST play push/fold poker
    - ANY playable hand = ALL-IN (pairs, aces, broadway, suited connectors)
    - Folding means blinds will eliminate you anyway
    - Your personality doesn't override survival math
    - If you have 1 BB or less, almost NEVER fold pre-flop

  # Firm tone for clear-headed players

  # Moderate made hand guidance (65-79% equity)
  # Firm tone for clear-headed players
  made_hand_moderate_firm: |-

  # Soft tone for tilted players (very light touch)
  made_hand_moderate_soft: |-
    You have {hand_name}.

  mind_games: |-
    MIND GAMES: Pay attention to what opponents said in Recent Actions. Are they nervous? Overconfident? Trying to tilt you or bait you into a bad call? Use their words to read their hand - excessive trash talk often means weakness, while silence or short responses may signal strength. Let their table talk influence your decision.

  persona_response: |-
    PERSONA RESPONSE: Talk directly to your opponents - taunt, trash talk, intimidate, or charm them. Stay in character as an exaggerated version of yourself. Reference specific opponents by name when needling them. Use your signature phrases and mannerisms. Mix up your energy - sometimes quiet menace, sometimes loud bravado. Emojis optional. Keep your actual hand SECRET - lie, misdirect, or stay cryptic.
