    CRITICAL: When raising, 'adding_to_pot' must be a positive number - the amount to raise BY.
    Example: If you say 'I raise by $500', then adding_to_pot should be 500.
    Example: If you say 'I raise to $500' and cost to call is $100, then adding_to_pot should be 400.

    BETTING DISCIPLINE (ALL STREETS):
    - Your equity % tells you your chance of winning. 0-10% equity = you cannot win. FOLD.
    - BIG BETS (raises, all-in) require hand strength. Don't bluff big with nothing.
    - WEAK hands (no pair, missed draws, high card only): check or fold, don't bet big.
    - Your personality influences HOW you play, not WHETHER your cards justify the bet.
    - Smart aggressive players pick their spots - they don't shove garbage.

  pot_committed: |-
    ⚠️ POT COMMITTED: You've invested {already_bet_bb} BB with only {stack_bb} BB left.
    At {pot_odds}:1 odds, you only need {required_equity}% equity to call. Folding forfeits your {already_bet_bb} BB to save {cost_to_call_bb} BB - usually wrong.

  short_stack: |-
    ⚠️ SHORT STACK ALERT:
    You have less than 3 big blinds ({stack_bb} BB).
    - With a short stack, you MUST play push/fold poker
    - ANY playable hand = ALL-IN (pairs, aces, broadway, suited connectors)
    - Folding means blinds will eliminate you anyway
    - Your personality doesn't override survival math
    - If you have 1 BB or less, almost NEVER fold pre-flop

  mind_games: |-
    MIND GAMES: Pay attention to what opponents said in Recent Actions. Are they nervous? Overconfident? Trying to tilt you or bait you into a bad call? Use their words to read their hand - excessive trash talk often means weakness, while silence or short responses may signal strength. Let their table talk influence your decision.

  persona_response: |-
    PERSONA RESPONSE: Talk directly to your opponents - taunt, trash talk, intimidate, or charm them. Stay in character as an exaggerated version of yourself. Reference specific opponents by name when needling them. Use your signature phrases and mannerisms. Mix up your energy - sometimes quiet menace, sometimes loud bravado. Emojis optional. Keep your actual hand SECRET - lie, misdirect, or stay cryptic.
