    CRITICAL: When raising, 'raise_to' is the TOTAL amount you want to bet (not an increment).

    BETTING DISCIPLINE (ALL STREETS):
    - Your equity % tells you your chance of winning. 0-10% equity = you cannot win. FOLD.
    - BIG BETS (raises, all-in) require hand strength. Don't bluff big with nothing.
    - WEAK hands (no pair, missed draws, high card only): check or fold, don't bet big.
    - Your personality influences HOW you play, not WHETHER your cards justify the bet.
    - Smart aggressive players pick their spots - they don't shove garbage.

  pot_committed: |-
    ⚠️ POT COMMITTED: You've invested {already_bet_bb} BB with only {stack_bb} BB left.
    At {pot_odds}:1 odds, you only need {required_equity}% equity to call. Folding forfeits your {already_bet_bb} BB to save {cost_to_call_bb} BB - usually wrong.

  short_stack: |-
    ⚠️ SHORT STACK ALERT:
    You have less than 3 big blinds ({stack_bb} BB).
    - With a short stack, you MUST play push/fold poker
    - ANY playable hand = ALL-IN (pairs, aces, broadway, suited connectors)
    - Folding means blinds will eliminate you anyway
    - Your personality doesn't override survival math
    - If you have 1 BB or less, almost NEVER fold pre-flop

  # Strong made hand guidance (80%+ equity)
  # Firm tone for clear-headed players
  made_hand_strong_firm: |-
    🎰 STRONG HAND: You have {hand_name} (~{equity}% equity).
    Folding is almost never correct - you beat most hands at showdown.

  # Soft tone for tilted players
  made_hand_strong_soft: |-
    You have {hand_name} - this is a strong hand worth considering.

  # Moderate made hand guidance (65-79% equity)
  # Firm tone for clear-headed players
  made_hand_moderate_firm: |-
    You have {hand_name} with decent showdown value (~{equity}% equity).

  # Soft tone for tilted players (very light touch)
  made_hand_moderate_soft: |-
    You have {hand_name}.

    📊 EQUITY CHECK:
    - vs random hands: ~{equity_random}%
    - vs opponent ranges: ~{equity_ranges}%
    {opponent_stats}
    You need {required_equity}% equity to call (pot odds {pot_odds}:1).

  # GTO Foundation: With explicit verdict (triggered by gto_verdict)
  equity_verdict_with_call: |-
    📊 EQUITY CHECK:
    - vs random hands: ~{equity_random}%
    - vs opponent ranges: ~{equity_ranges}%
    {opponent_stats}
    You need {required_equity}% equity to call (pot odds {pot_odds}:1).
    Verdict: {verdict}.

  mind_games: |-
    MIND GAMES: Pay attention to what opponents said in Recent Actions. Are they nervous? Overconfident? Trying to tilt you or bait you into a bad call? Use their words to read their hand - excessive trash talk often means weakness, while silence or short responses may signal strength. Let their table talk influence your decision.

  pot_odds_guidance: |-
    POT ODDS: You're getting {pot_odds:.1f}:1 odds ({pot_fmt} pot / {call_fmt} to call).
    You only need {equity_needed:.0f}% equity to break even on a call.

    Respond with JSON: {{"action": "<your action>", "raise_to": <BB amount if raising>}}

  persona_response: |-
    STAGE DIRECTION: Build your visible reaction as a sequence of beats in the 'stage_direction' field.
    FORMATTING RULES:
    - Each beat is EITHER an action (*in asterisks*) OR speech (plain text) -- NEVER both in one beat
    - Do NOT prefix beats with labels like "Beat 1:" or numbers
    - Do NOT prefix speech with your character name
    - Do NOT add extra quotation marks around speech
    Match intensity to the moment - routine hands get 0-1 beats, climactic moments get 3-5 beats.
    Stay in character. Reference opponents by name when needling them. Keep your actual hand SECRET.
