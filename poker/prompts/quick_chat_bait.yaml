  instruction: |-
    Write 2 messages for {player_name} to say to {target_player} at a poker table.

    GOAL: Lure them into overplaying. Give off a vibe of mild frustration or casual respect — just enough that they feel in control and bet bigger than they should.

    CONTEXT:
    {context_str}
    {chat_context}

    {length_guidance}
    {intensity_guidance}

    EXAMPLES:
    - "Nice bet, {target_first_name}."
    - "I keep running into you."
    - "Ugh, really?"
    - "You've been on a roll."

    Be SUBTLE. You're planting a feeling, not announcing a strategy. Sound like someone who's slightly annoyed or grudgingly impressed — never like you're acting. Do NOT ask questions or challenge them — that's a different tactic. You're complimenting or sighing, not interrogating.

    Return JSON: {{"suggestions": [{{"text": "...", "tone": "bait"}}, {{"text": "...", "tone": "bait"}}], "targetPlayer": "{target_player}"}}
