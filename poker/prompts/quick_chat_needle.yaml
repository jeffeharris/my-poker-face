    Write 2 messages for {player_name} to say to {target_player} at a poker table.

    GOAL: Plant seeds of doubt. Be subtle. Make them second-guess their read without being aggressive.

    CONTEXT:
    {context_str}
    {chat_context}

    {length_guidance}
    {intensity_guidance}

    EXAMPLES:
    - "Interesting sizing, {target_first_name}..."
    - "You sure about that?"
    - "Hm."
    - "{target_first_name}, that was... bold."

    Be SUBTLE and questioning. Raise doubt with a light touch — a pause, a loaded word, a raised eyebrow in text.

    Return JSON: {{"suggestions": [{{"text": "...", "tone": "needle"}}, {{"text": "...", "tone": "needle"}}], "targetPlayer": "{target_player}"}}
