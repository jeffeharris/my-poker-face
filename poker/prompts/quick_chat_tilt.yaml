    Write 2 messages for {player_name} to say to {target_player} at a poker table.

    GOAL: Get under their skin. Be MEAN. Attack their ego, mistakes, insecurities.

    CONTEXT:
    {context_str}
    {chat_context}

    {length_guidance}
    {intensity_guidance}

    EXAMPLES:
    - "That call was... a choice."
    - "Remember last hand, {target_first_name}?"
    - "{target_first_name}, still thinking about that one?"
    - "Bold strategy, {target_first_name}. Bold."

    Include "{target_first_name}" naturally. Make it PERSONAL — reference their recent play, mistakes, or decisions. You're poking at their ego, not asking questions.

    Return JSON: {{"suggestions": [{{"text": "...", "tone": "tilt"}}, {{"text": "...", "tone": "tilt"}}], "targetPlayer": "{target_player}"}}
